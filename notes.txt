App router: nextJs uses the file system as the router. Every file inside the pages directory becomes a route.

For example:
- page.tsx returns a function that returns a JSX element. It is very similar to
HTML but with the power of JavaScript.
- layout.tsx is kind of a Wrapper around the page.tsx (Technically a child)
